  Remove array item matching \e[32ms\e[0m => \e[32ma=("${(@)a:#s}")\e[0m
      \e[32m:#\e[0m is the hieroglyph to remove matching elements;
      Use \e[32m""\e[0m and \e[32m@\e[0m to keep empty elements (otherwise
      they are removed too).

  Does a glob match at least one (1) item => \e[32m[[ -n *(#qN) ]]\e[22m
